The donation matching application allows donors to create a donation with multiple items, then provides a list of distribution agencies that are eligible to receive the donation. Receiving agencies can register and create a profile that informs the matching algorithm of the particular restrictions each agency faces allowing for a smarter, quicker matching process. Agencies are able to track where their donations came from, allowing for safer food handling practices and a more impactful and less wasteful outcome. Built with Ruby on Rails.
